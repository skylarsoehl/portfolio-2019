We were given complete freedom over the form of this project, the only exception that our idea must be translated into digital form.I have always been a purveyor of justice for marginalized groups and took this assignment as an opportunity to try designing for social awareness. I was inspired by my late grandfather who, as a double amputee, constantly struggled to use public transportation."

                       This project started with an exercise that required me to ride the T. The experience map  below illustrates my very first experience with Boston's transit system. Growing up close to New York City, I was no stranger to public transportation, however, I have never been in a situation where I needed to independently navigate through public transit. This led to my anxious and frustrating "adventure" on the T.

                    <P>
                        Secondly, I planned to spend time developing NUWITâ€™s brand and creating an official design system + brand book that could be used by future design and web chairs. After spending a semester working as a developer for Scout, I was inspired to create something similar (albeit more simple) for NUWIT. As we continue to grow, having a guidelines to inform future design-related activities will be important for distinguishing and promoting the organization.
